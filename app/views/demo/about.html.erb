              <p>I started creating this site to see what I learned from a previous
              intructor taught course. I had hiccups, but stack overflow helps with
              a lot. Some problems took hours, while some took minutes. This was
              a great way for me to keep learning and test what I need to improve on.</p>

              <p>One of the hardest parts was the gallery. I could have done something
              like Lightbox for a gallery, but was determined to make create something 
              like the one I used. It took me many hours until I was satisfied
              with the way it works, and I learned a ton from the experience.  </p>
