            <p> I wanted to make this site in order to test what I needed to 
              improve on, and I learned that there are quite a few things. I 
              struggled at times, and spent hours trying to fix issues that weren't broken,
              but in the end building this site gave me a much better
              understanding of how to build a site from start to finish.</p>

              enjoyed building this website.</p>
