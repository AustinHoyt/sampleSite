# README

I started this very basic project to create a site from scratch using what
I had learned in previous projects. 

I'm passionate about learning as much as I can, and input would be appreciated 
on what I can improve. The jumbotron should probably not be used like it was.. I was 
curious, but it eventually worked out exactly like I wanted so I kept it.
